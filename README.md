# Sodium-Ion Cathode Discovery

Data-Driven Screening Using Machine Learning and Computational Modeling
## üß† Overview

This project explores the intelligent discovery and optimization of sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode materials using machine learning, materials informatics, and advanced computational frameworks. It is part of an MSc thesis at Imperial College London ‚Äì Department of Materials.

## Key research goals:

Predict voltage, phase stability, and volumetric changes of O3-type layered transition metal oxides.

Develop a new database of NaxNi‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÖMayMbzO‚ÇÇ cathode materials using DFT and machine learning-based feature extraction.

Enable reverse design of high-performance SIB cathodes through ML-guided screening.

## Key Topics Covered

* `Combinatorial Explosion in materials discovery/:

* `Chemical Filtering using SMACT rules and oxidation states/`:

* `Compositional & Stoichiometric Screening of transition metal oxides/`:

* `Structure Prediction using Chemeleon/`:

## Advanced Computational Methods, including:

* `Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFF) with MACE/`:

* `Density Functional Theory (DFT) with VASP/`:

* `Graph-based models for phase stability prediction/`:
