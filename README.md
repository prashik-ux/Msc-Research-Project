**üì¶ Sodium-Ion Cathode Discovery**

Data-Driven Screening Using Machine Learning and Computational Modeling
üß† Overview

This project explores the intelligent discovery and optimization of sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathode materials using machine learning, materials informatics, and advanced computational frameworks. It is part of an MSc thesis at Imperial College London ‚Äì Department of Materials.

Key research goals:

Predict voltage, phase stability, and volumetric changes of O3-type layered transition metal oxides.

Develop a new database of NaxNi‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÖMayMbzO‚ÇÇ cathode materials using DFT and machine learning-based feature extraction.

Enable reverse design of high-performance SIB cathodes through ML-guided screening.
